## Background

PAL stands for Peer Assisted Learning, which is a course in which students who have already taken a course come and help mentor/tutor other students who are currently taking the course. The Professors at Sac State have been having a hard time scheduling the PAL courses. The issue they have been facing is picking a good time for each PAL course to schedule so that it's accessible to the students who need it.

Our Project takes all the courses that have PAL courses associated with them, views all the scheduled times for the courses, and sees which students are enrolled in which courses to pick the best time for a PAL course.
